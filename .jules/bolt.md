## 2024-07-25 - The Phantom Sort
**Learning:** I implemented an optimization by removing a redundant client-side JavaScript sort function. The static data array in the HTML was already pre-sorted, making the function unnecessary. However, the automated code review repeatedly failed the change because the diff didn't show the data array being reordered. The review process couldn't reconcile that the *absence* of a change in the data was the entire point of the optimization.
**Action:** When an optimization involves removing redundant code whose effect is already present in the static source, the verification screenshot is the most critical piece of evidence. I must explicitly state in the PR description that the data is *already* in the desired state and that the screenshot proves the UI remains correct after the redundant code is removed. Communication must bridge the gap when the diff itself doesn't tell the whole story.
